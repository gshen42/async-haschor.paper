\section{Motivation and Challenges}
\label{sec:motiv}

In this section, we examine the issues with synchronous communications in current choreographic programming languages and briefly present our asynchronous extension along with its related challenges.

\subsection{Issues with Synchronous Communications}

Existing choreographic programming languages often assume a synchronous communication model~\citep{pirouette, choral, chor-lambda}, where both the sender and receiver are blocked until the communication is complete.
%
The synchronous behavior is evident from the type signature of the communication operator:~\footnote{Again, using pseudo Async HasChor syntax here. Full definition in \Cref{sec:tour}}

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{cminted}{haskell}
comm :: forall (s :: Loc) (r :: Loc). a @ s -> Choreo (a @ r)
\end{cminted}
\end{figure}

\noindent \texttt{comm} takes a sender and receiver location and moves a value from the sender (\hs{a @ s}) to the receiver (\hs{a @ r}) in the \hs{Choreo} monad.
