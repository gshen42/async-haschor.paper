\section{A tour of Async HasChor}
\label{sec:tour}

\noindent In this choreography, Alice first performs some local compuation to obtain the input \texttt{x} using the \texttt{locally} operator.
%
Alice then processes the data by applying function \texttt{f} to \texttt{x} and communicates the result to Bob using the \texttt{comm} operator, with the final result bound to \texttt{y}.
%
Similarily, Bob processes the data with function \texttt{g} and communicates the result to Carol, who again processes the data with function \texttt{h} and returns the result to Alice.
%
Finally, Alice performs another local computation to present the result.
