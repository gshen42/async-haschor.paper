\title{Async HasChor: Asynchronous Functional Choreographic Programming}

\begin{abstract}
Choreographic programming is a paradigm that models a distributed system as a unified program, which is then endpoint projected into individual programs for each participant.
%
Thanks to its global point of view, communication among participants is manifest, and theyâ€™re guaranteed to match with each other, leading to a deadlock-free-by-design construction.
%
However, existing choreographic programming languages assume a synchronous network model where communication blocks both sender and receiver.
%
This assumption not only is inefficient as it limits the amount of concurrency but also makes it impossible to express useful protocols.

In this paper, we present Async HasChor, an extension that adds asynchronous communication to the library-level choreographic programming language HasChor.
%
The key idea is to make communication return a \emph{future} and spawn threads for sending and receiving.
%
One challenge of this approach is that now messages can arrive out of order, and if not dealt correctly can lead to serious bugs at run time.
%
To overcome the challenge, we tag each message with a sequence number and argument endpoint projection to automatically generate these numbers consistently among participants.
%
We evaluate Async HasChor ...
